# Human Readable Time #
A program which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

    HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
    MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
    SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59

The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)
